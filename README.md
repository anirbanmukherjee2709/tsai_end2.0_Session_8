# Objective
The task was to convert the code base here:
Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation- https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/2%20-%20Learning%20Phrase%20Representations%20using%20RNN%20Encoder-Decoder%20for%20Statistical%20Machine%20Translation.ipynb

and

Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate- https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/3%20-%20Neural%20Machine%20Translation%20by%20Jointly%20Learning%20to%20Align%20and%20Translate.ipynb
 

which used legacy Pytorch code and rewrite them using the latest libraries of Pytorch. 



# Solution
Both code-bases were attempted and thus re-written with the latest Pytorch libraries.
